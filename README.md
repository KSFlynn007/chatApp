# chatApp

chatApp is created with React Native, built with Expo.
Start by making sure you have the most recent version of Node installed, check with node -v in your terminal.

## scripts

## npm install expo-cli --global

Download Expo on your OS to run, you will need to make a free account.

### npm start/expo start

This script will run the expo program, open a new window to work in. Note that I usually set my connection to tunnel vs. LAN.
