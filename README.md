# chatApp

chatApp is created with React Native, developed with Expo. It provides a chat interface and options for users to send images, take a photo, which are saved to the Google firestore, and share their location.

## set up
Start by making sure you have the most recent version of Node installed, check with node -v in your terminal.

## scripts

``` npm install expo-cli --global ```

Download Expo on your OS to run, you will need to make a free account.

``` npm start/expo start ```

This script will run the expo program, open a new window to work in. Note that I usually set my connection to tunnel vs. LAN.
